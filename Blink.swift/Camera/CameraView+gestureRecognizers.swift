     Handles pinch to zoom functionality of the camera
    
     ## Notes
     Enables the user to zoom in and out while the camera is open. Whenever the zoom factor of the IOS is manipulated, the capture device (front or back camera(s)) must be locked for configuration. The beginning zoom scale is saved as a global variable and is referenced everytime the zoomGesture is initiated. The cameras zoomfactor is set to the zoomScale which is calculated as follows:
     
     min ( max(beginZoomScale * pinch.scale , 1.0 ) , maximum zoom factor)
     
     Whenever the LHS exceeds the max zoom scale on the RHS of the min() function, the zoomScale variable will always be set to the maximum since the maximum zoom factor on the RHS would be the minimum: the LHS > RHS so return RHS. As for the inner max() function, 1.0 will be returned or begin zoomScale * pinch.scale. pinch.scale returns a value greater than 1 if pinch to zoom and a value less than 1 but greater than 0 if pinch to zoom out. if zoomScale is less than 1.0,  1.0 will always be returned. This makes it so the zoomScale will not be less than 1.0.

     ## Notes
     This is toggled on when recording and toggled off when not recording. See zoomGesture above to see the handling of the min/max functions. This works the same way with a slight difference because a pan gesture uses translation difference, as opposed to pinch scale, and is only concerned with the y-axis
