     Enables the user to zoom in and out while the camera is open. Whenever the zoom factor of the IOS is manipulated, the capture device (front or back camera(s)) must be locked for configuration. The beginning zoom scale is saved as a global variable and is referenced everytime the zoomGesture is initiated. The cameras zoomfactor is set to the zoomScale which is calculated as follows:
     
     min ( max(beginZoomScale * pinch.scale , 1.0 ) , maximum zoom factor)
     
     Whenever the max zoom scale is exceeded on the LHS of the min() function, the zoomScale will always be set to the maximum since the maximum zoom factor on the RHS would be the minimum in this case. As for the inner max() function. Either the pinch scale
